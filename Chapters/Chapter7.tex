One of the aims of this project was to create hardware that is capable of successfully spoofing a GPS receiver. From the results it can be seen that the method of
spoofing using signals generated from coodinates was successful. That hardware that has been used for this is capable of performing any spoofing attack, however the
software was not cable to produce the results at times, where anti-spoofing was at play.
Overall the accuracy of the position gathered from the GPS receivers was poorer than expected, although
to be able to spoof anything at all was considered a success. Given these results were gathered in a conntrolled environmennt more care will need to be taken if
performing these experiments in the field. The project was able to provide a foundation for which further research into GNSS attack and defence strategies can be
performed. SDR devices are prevelant in EW research due to their combination of hardware level performance and software level felxibilty. This will allow for further
research into other areas of EW.
