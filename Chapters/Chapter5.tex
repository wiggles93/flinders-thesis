\section{GNSS Reception} \label{sec:Res_GNSSReception}
Before testing the GPS transmission performance of the SDR, reception was tested, with less success. Three antenna setups were chosen each failing to lock and track the
satellites. A log linear, an omnidirectional and an active patch antenna were all used. The active antenna should have given best results since it includes amplifiers and
filters within the antenna module itself. The failure could be to do with the bias-t used to inject the 5V DC into the antenna, however testing with a multi-meter showed
that there was 5V on the RF+DC port of the Tee.

\section{GPS Transmission} \label{sec:Res_GPSTransmission}
Experimentation was performed at the Tonsley campus of Flinders University, which has coordinates of $-35.007650, 138.572030$. At first it was decided to use the
centre of the Adelaide CBD as the coordinates for spoofing, that is $-34.5571732282, 138.3599516878$. Therefore it would be considered successful if the GPS receiver was to show
that the current location was in the CBD. This was extended to include other locations, Davis Station in Antarctica and the MAB at Flinders University Tonsley Campus with
coordinates of $-68.5762449235, 77.9696166515$ and $-35.00792163316667, 138.5715065625$ respectively.

Dynamic spoofing attacks were set to the road surrounding the MAB and around the CBD of Adelaide. All spoof attack dates were set to the same date, which was chosen to be
the 30th March 2021. This was arbitrary and only chosen since this was when official testing began.

\subsection{Meaconing Attack}
Since the GPS reception failed with the SDR, there was no way of performing a meaconing attack. Therefore, the only viable attack strategy was to generate a binary file
of the intended location. It would be ideal to perform this kind of attack in the future since this is the only basic attack type that can be used on the encrypted
military band.

\subsection{Spoofing Attack}
Once the workflow and hardware setup for the SDR was properly configured it was found that a smartphone was able to be spoofed.
When attempting to spoof devices in the wild, the Pixel XL smartphone was susceptible to attack while more modern smartphones that were tested were not susceptible. These
included the iPhone 12 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S10 and Google Pixel 3XL. The spoofing setup was not able to fool any of these devices. This could be down to software based
anti-spoofing algorithms that have been implemented including the usage of multiple constellations for position resolution.

\subsection{Static Spoofing}
\subsubsection{Tonsley MAB}
The grassed area outside of the Flinders University Tonsley campus was chosen as one of the points to spoof to. As mentioned above the desired coordinates that the receiver were
$-35.00792163316667, 138.5715065625$.

The $\frac{C}{N_0}$ ratio graph for the static MAB spoof attack, see Figure \ref{fig:MABStaticCNo}, shows that there was a good quality signal being received throughout
the test, with no evidence of under running. 
In this example the time to first fix was calculated as being 37 seconds. This is quite good for a cold start situation. During experimentation the time to first fix has
been variable between 30 seconds and 180 seconds. A trend has been the quicker the fix the better the overall accuracy of the spoofed location.
At approximately the time of first fix it can be seen that there was a reduction in number of satellite PRNs being received. Then throughout there was spikes from various
satellites. These spikes offer no benefit since they only lasted a few seconds. 

From Figures \ref{fig:MABStaticPosition} and \ref{fig:MABStaticCoord} it can be seen that there are not many GPS location points on this graph, so while the spoof was
successful in the sense that the receiver was able to interpret a location. The calculated location had a high error and there was clearly not a consistent lock. This
experiment should have been redone ensuring that there was no interference in the Faraday cage causing the lock to be lost. 
The extent of the error and lack of data points are more evident in Figures \ref{fig:MABStaticError} and \ref{fig:MABSatelliteImage}.

\subsubsection{Antarctica}
Davis station in Antarctica was chosen as a location for spoofing. As mentioned above the coordinates for this location was $-68.5762449235, 77.9696166515$. The COTS
receiver was used as a spoof victim and it was successfully spoofed. Figure \ref{fig:antarcticaStaticCNo} shows the carrier to noise graph over the spoof attack. There is
a consistent value of $\approx 50 dBHz$ plus signals that are consistently at $\approx 40 dBHz$. These values indicate low interference and high signal quality. There
were more SVIDs (or PRN codes) than expected, with more SVIDs recorded than there are GPS satellites in operation. 
Time to first fix was shown to be approximately 60 seconds, this is the lower end of the fix times from experiments for cold starts. 
It can be see that there is consistent signals for the first 50 seconds. For the time period between 70 and
200 seconds there was more volatile signal quality. Figure \ref{fig:antarcticaStaticError} shows that there was a high, but consistent level of error between first fix
and 140 seconds. After this there was a spike, which is associated with a drop of lock, and the high error remained until the end of the test. This high error is evident
when viewing the raw position in Figure \ref{fig:antarcticaStaticCoord} and with respect to the desired location, Figure \ref{fig:antarcticaStaticPosition}. Figure \ref{fig:antarcticaSatelliteImage} shows this error
in position in more context placed over a satellite image.
The inaccuracy is higher than was expected from this experiment.

\subsection{Dynamic Spoofing}
Dynamic spoofing attacks were also performed. These attacks do not have a set coordinate that the spoofer is attempting to make the receiver appear at, rather these
attacks try to get the receiver to "follow" a path that has been set, see Section \ref{subsec:coordinate}.
\subsubsection{Tonsley MAB}
There is a road that circles around the MAB (Mass Assembly Building) in which the \univname Tonsley campus is situated. This was used as a path to spoof the GPS receiver,
see Figure \ref{fig:MABdynamicSetup}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \begin{centering}
        \includegraphics[width=12cm,keepaspectratio]{Figures/2021_3_30_dynamic_MAB_setup.png}
        \caption{Using road around the MAB at Tonsley, Adelaide as path for dynamic spoofing attack. The file was saved as a text file to be compiled into a binary.}
        \label{fig:MABdynamicSetup}
    \end{centering}
\end{figure}

The time to first fix was found to be approximately 49 seconds which is considered quick for a cold start. The $\frac{C}{N_0}$ ratio graph, see \ref{fig:MABdynamicCNo} shows a common trend of having
a high average of $\approx 50dBHz$ average with some lower values from spikes. These spikes would not add any value to the quality of the fix and given more time the
cause of the spikes would be found. From Figure \ref{fig:MABdynamicCoord} it can be seen that initially there was high amounts of error while getting the initial fix.
Though when the movement began there was good tracking. This is evident in Figure \ref{fig:MABdynamicPosition} where the reference path and received path were overlaid.
Overlaying onto a satellite image yielded \ref{fig:MABdynamicSatelliteImage} which shows how well the spoof attack was able to track the reference path. This produced
results that would be expected from authentic GPS signals, with the exception being the initial part of the experiment.

\section{Experimental Issues}
While performing experiments there were issues that were run into that were required to be overcome. Initially a Log Periodic antenna was used for transmission since its
frequency range was appropriate for use transmitting L1 band signals. After experiments failed to pick up any signals it was swapped for a omnidirectional antenna. This
was able to produce signals that were picked up by the GNSS Logger application. Observing the graphs of the carrier to noise figure showed that when there was an under run
issue the $\frac{C}{N_0}$ would drop to 0 and the GPS receiver would lose connection to the 'satellites'. This meant that no GPS lock was achievable.

The under run issue was more or less solved by increasing the buffer size to $40\times$ greater than the sampling size.
There was an issue towards the end of the project where there was considerable leakage of EM radiation into the Faraday cage that was causing the GPS receiver to produce
wildly inaccurate position (up to and over 500m error). This was much different to what had previously been recorded within the Faraday cage. This amount of error does
not constitute a successful spoof since the time to first lock was much greater than a real signal, or even spoofing attempts previously. 

During initial testing of the spoofing there was an inability to get the spoofer to correctly spoof the receiver. It was found that there is a requirement that the ratio
between the sampling frequency and clock frequency of the radio must be an integer value. Therefore when compiling the signal using GPS-SDR-sim the sampling frequency
value was required to be changed to 2.5Msps.  

Just after the testing phase of the project the smartphone that was being used for some of the logging and graphing was rendered unusable. While there was no data lost,
it was replaced with a newer model that experimentally was much harder to spoof than the previous model. This could be due to many factors including anti-spoofing
algorithms \cite{RN39}. It would be a fair assessment that the newer device is able to receive more GNSS signals including augmented systems as well as other signals such as Wi-Fi.
The connection to the Wi-Fi signal was such that notifications were coming up on the phone while performing the experiments.

There were a number of unterminated cables that were running from outside of the cage to inside. This was seen as being the cause of the issues that were being faced. The
suspect cables were removed or terminated and the results were more consistent with what was being achieved previously. Even with the new phone the GPS location was able
to be spoofed.

A common result from spoofed attempts was to have GPS satellites with an SVID of 193. GPS satellites have PRN codes from 1-63 and SBAS have PRNs from
64 to 158 \cite{RN67}. From the list of PRN codes \cite{RN67} it can be seen that PRN 193 is used by one of the QZSS satellites. This is likely a result of stray EM waves
penetrating the Faraday cage. It is unlikely that the GPS-SDR-sim program includes augmentation systems when generating spoofed signals. The orbit of the QZSS satellites
does include Australia so seems most likely an issue where an unterminated cable is allowing the signal to bleed into the cage.

In an attempt to overcome the under run \todo{insert graph of under run}issue that was plaguing the experiments, a new PC was brought in with Ubuntu installed directly instead of via a VM. This resulted
in the radio working straight away. The under run issues resurfaced when trying to read the serial data from a COTS GPS receiver. This was less than ideal and required a
second computer to act as a datalogger.
