\medskip
Previous research into the use of SDR (software defined radio) for GPS spoofing uses has lead to common conclusions.
That is, that the use of open sourcecannot  software to ease the development. Namely multiple previous attempts at GPS spoofing
used the GNSS-SDR program for reception and the gps-sdr-sim for transmission. Both of these are available from GitHub as free
and open source programs.\\

Spoofing can be defined as an intentional interfering signal that aims to make GNSS receivers produce incorrect positoning data\cite{RN8}.
\emph{GPS Spoofing has been researched actively for over 12 years and yet there doesn't seem to be any wide spread anti-spoofing technique adoption.}\todo{remove}

\bigskip
From literature the consensus is that the same thing that has made GPS ubiquitous with navigation and 
positioning has also made it a simple target for exploitation and manipulation, that is the workings
of the infrastructure are well known and public and are transparent and predictable \cite{RN7} \cite{RN4}. This is problematic since this infrastructure
is seen as a critical service by many industries including utility management, healthcare/ emergency services and security.
Having such a system so prone to threats is not ideal. The further development of SDR platforms has driven down the cost of launching
such exploits. Devices such as the HackRF, USRP, BladeRF and others have been documented for this use \cite{RN4} \cite{RN9}.

\medskip

An issue that arises when attempting to spoof a mobile device is that these devices are also able to determine locaiton based off of
network connection. \todo{insert citation for finding location from cellular/wifi connection}
K. Zeng et al. \cite{RN9} found that when these kinds of devices registered a difference in location between network based and GPS based
that they would prioritise the GPS based location. \todo{I think this is wrong}\emph{This is less of an issue than at first glance since the prevalence of VPN (virtual private networks)
are increasing for surcumventing geolocking features. Therefore to ensure that GPS locaiton services still function when a VPN is active
the GPS position should be prioritised.} There are other methods of detecting a faulty GPS signal in software and hardware that are
more accurate and allow for more flexibility of the device usage.

\subsection{Annotated Bibliography}

\textbf{\emph{Spotr: GPS Spoofing detection via Device Fingerprinting} by M. Foruhandeh et al.}\\
As discussed in \cite{RN7} GPS (Global Positioning System) has become the de facto positioning infrastructure for civilian and 
military usage and while there are other satellite based positioning systems that are becoming more popular (GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou) GPS is 
still the one that most people think of when thinking about GNSS. GPS provides this service globally and efficiently although through its ubiquity
security concerns have become apparent. Attacks have been carried out in both an academic and industry setting.
The authors \todo{remove reference to "authors"} believed that strengthening of the GPS framework against manipulation and exploitation must be a priority.
Proposed methods of hardening GPS have been previously proposed, however these were typically abandoned due to expense, complexity, cost or lack of robustness. 
A method of creating unique satellite "fingerprints" was developed and tested against all known spoofing attacks at time of publish.
This fingerprint algorithm was able to determine if a transmission was authentic or spoofed.
This fingerprinting algorithm implementation was found to be fast, simple, cost effective and robust when compared to previous hardening attempts. \todo{Fact check the claims of the paper}

\textbf{\emph{Hijacking Unmanned Aerial Vehicle by Exploiting civil GPS vulnerabilities Using SDR} by X. Zheng et al.}\\
As written by X. Zheng et al. \cite{RN4} there has been an exponential increase in the number of UAV vehicles being used in recent times.
This increase has been driven by the advent of aerial photography of both professionals and amateurs since the cost of entry is so low. There are
also companies looking to implement delivery services using UAV, or drone, technology.
This poses security and safety concerns with such vehicles having such a reliance on GPS for accurate positioning. Having such an open and transparent
infrastructure such as that of GPS makes the signals easy to reproduce for nefarious purposes. Adding to the concern is the increase in 
affordable and high performance SDR platforms as well as open source software packages designed to minimise complexity of performing such tasks. X.Zheng et al.
showed that performing spoofing attacks on UAV vehicles is cheap and simple to control. Zheng performed 3 different hijacking attacks on the target
UAV, namely forcing the drone to land, guiding the drone to an attacker dictated area and forcing the drone to land in an attacker dictated area.
Two of the attack methods were successful. Zheng also provided some recommendations for improving the security of the GPS system of, in particular
DJI Phantom 3 drones.

\textbf{\emph{Practical GPS location spoofing attack in Road Navigation} by K. Zeng et al.} \\
K. Zeng et al. provide insight into the security concerns of leaning so heavily on the GPS system in general, and more important to this
paper is the reliance on GPS for navigation. In their paper \cite{RN9} K. Zeng et al. were able to develop a practical algorithm
implementation for road network modelling and navigation spoofing using GPS. The attack model used was a hardware based approach. 
The proposed attack strategy leveraged a lunch box sized portable spoofer with the HackRF at the heart of the device. Alot of the effort
of this paper went into the production of the dynamic modelling of road network algorithm. This was done using an XML (extensible markup language)
version of an area of streets as provided by OpenStreetMap. The documentation of this algorithm will become 
useful when moving from a static based spoof attack to a dynamic one.

\medskip

\textbf{\emph{A Low complexity GPS anti-spoofing method using multi antenna array} by S. Daneshmand et al.} \\
In 2012 S. Daneshmand et al. \cite{RN8} proposed a low computational complexity anti spoofing module for use with GPS receivers.
It was mentioned that previous anti-spoofing reasearch was done in two categories, spoofing detection and spoofing mitigation.
Most of the effort has been put into spoofing detection algorthims and less on mitigation techniques. 
Previous proposed spoofing mitigation devices used the fact that GPS spoofing devices typically transmit multiple PRN's. 
Therefore comparisons can be made between the spoofed and authentic signals. Although this is computationally complex. This proposed
device uses a multi antenna array to find the signal with most power and beam form in such a way that the antenna null is pointing in
that direction. This relies on the assumption that spoofed signals will have a measurably higher spatial energy than that of the authentic signal
as well as the authentic signal propogating from an area that is not also covered by an antenna null. Although this cannot be guarenteed.
To maximise the perfomance of the module, the authors also propose a technique to amplify the authentic signals as well as reduce the noise floor level.
S. Daneshmand mentioned that with some minor modifications the proposed module would be able to opearate with GLONASS and Galileo systems aswell. 

\medskip

\textbf{\emph{Practical Cryptographic Civil GPS signal authentication} by K. Wesson et al.} \\
K. Wesson et al. \cite{RN13} propose a method for counteracting GPS spoofing on the popular GPS civil band. The proposed method would use cryptographic
authentication based techniques to ensure that signals were not fake.
The implementation of such a system would require modifications to the GPS satellite system themselves. These modifications are documentated by
K. Wesson.
The use of cryptographic techniques were evaluated to determine which was the most effective.

\medskip

\textbf{\emph{Design of complete Software GPS Simulator with low complexity and precise Multipath Channel model} by A. Elango et al.} \\ 
In 2016 A. Elango proposed a completly software based approch to simulating GPS singals \cite{RN15}. A summary of the difference between analog
and digital based simulation systems is provided, with justification for producing a softawre based solution. In this proposal the GPS signals are created
using a custom piece of software. The output of this software is a message that has already been moudlated, which is saved into a file on the local
storage device. This was then fed into a MATLAB simulation environment for testing. The psudo code for the development of the program is include in
the publication, and provides a good resource for breaking down the message structure for GPS.

\medskip

\textbf{\emph{GNSS Spoofing and Detection} by M. Psiaki et al.} \\
\textbf{This is a really good reference for the state of play in the spoof attack and defence landscape. Spend time reading about the techniques and 
gain an understanding}.\\
In 2016 M. Psiaki et al. \cite{RN12} reviewed the state of GNSS spoofing and spoofing defences. Since 2008 there has been an ever increasing 
interest in GNSS spoofing. A spoofer could potentially target both military and civilian infrastructure including Aircraft or marine vessels which
rely on GNSS signals especially in low visibility conditions. Civilian infrastructure like cell phone towers, power gtrid monitoring and stock markets
use GPS signals for precise timing. This paper looks at the details of the current methods of implementing a GPS spoof attack as well as the details
of known anti spoofing techniques. Attack methods tested were self consistent spoofer, Meacoming and estimate and replay attacks, other advanced techniques.
\todo{expand on these techniques}Defence techniques were advnaced signal processing techniques, encryption based, drift monitoring, signal geometry and multi pronged spoofing defence.
A table was generated to visualise which defence stratagies were effective against which attack strategies. 
It was found that all attack strategies that were used in the report were effective against COTS (commercial off the shelf) GNSS receivers. The authors
recommend COTS GNSS receiver producers implement, at a minimum, a rudamentary defence strategy against spoof attacks. 

\medskip

\textbf{\emph{GNSS-SDR: An Open Source tool for Researchers and Developers} by C. Fern\'andes-Prades} \\
The software has undergone continual development since this paper was written. Therefore more recent version of article should be found.
Although information may still be relevant\cite{RN16}.
In 2011 C. Fern\'andes-Prades et al. developed an open source piece of software for the development and implementation of software defined radio based
GNSS receivers. At the time there was a void of accessible software radio solutions that allowed the used to investigate how a GNSS receiver worked.
The author mentions existing commercial products, as they allow for the useage of the data that GNSS systems provide.
The paper walks through the architecture of the GNSS-SDR program.
