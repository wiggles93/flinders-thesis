\section{Introduction}

In this section the previous work in the field will be explored. This will give the reader adequte understanding of where 
advances in the research area can be made.\todo{Write intro to the lit review}

\medskip
This is a list of things that need to be in a lit review:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Why are you writing the review, and why the topic is important
        \item the scope of the review - what aspects of the topic will be discussed
        \item the criteria used for your literature selection (types of sources used and dates etc.)
        \item the orgonisational structure of the review
    \end{itemize}
    \item Body Paragraphs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item historical background
        \item methodologies
        \item previous studies
        \item mainstream vs. alternative viewpoints
        \item principal questions being asked
        \item general conclusions being drawn
    \end{itemize}
    \item Conclusion 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Main agreements and disagreements of the literature
        \item any gaps or areas of futher research
        \item my overall perspective on the topic
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\medskip
Checklist for a literature review. Have I:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Outlined the purpose and scope
    \item Identified appropriate and credible (academic/scholary) literature
    \item Recorded the bibliographical details of the sources
    \item Analysed and critqued your readings
    \item Identified gaps in the readings
    \item explored methodologies / theories / hypotheses / models?
    \item discussed varying viewpoints
    \item written an intro, body and conclusion
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
Items that I want to cover in the Lit review
\begin{itemize}
    \item Using SDR (USRP) to receive GPS signal
    \item Using SDR to transmit GPS signal
    \item Algorithms for generating spoofed signal
    \item GPS Antispoofing techniques
    \item OPTIONAL: Difference between Block II and block III satellites
\end{itemize}
\medskip
Previous research into the use of SDR (software defined radio) for GPS spoofing uses has lead to common conclusions.
That is, that the use of open source software to ease the development. Namely multiple previous attempts at GPS spoofing
used the GNSS-SDR program for reception and the gps-sdr-sim for transmission. Both of these are available from GitHub as free
and open source programs.
