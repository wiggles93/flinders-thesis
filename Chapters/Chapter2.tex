\medskip
Previous research into the use of SDR (software defined radio) for GPS spoofing uses has lead to common conclusions.
That is, that the use of open sourcecannot  software to ease the development. Namely multiple previous attempts at GPS spoofing
used the GNSS-SDR program for reception and the gps-sdr-sim for transmission. Both of these are available from GitHub as free
and open source programs. The issue of GPS spoofing is not uniquly that of position. Since GNSS systems have highly accurate time keeping
facilities, in the form of atomic clocks, they are used to maintain accurate time of critical infrastructure like \todo{list things that rely on GPS timing}\\

Spoofing can be defined as an intentional interfering signal that aims to make GNSS receivers produce incorrect positoning data\cite{RN8}.
\emph{GPS Spoofing has been researched actively for over 12 years and yet there doesn't seem to be any wide spread anti-spoofing technique adoption.}\todo{remove}

\bigskip
From literature the consensus is that the same thing that has made GPS ubiquitous with navigation and 
positioning has also made it a simple target for exploitation and manipulation, that is the workings
of the infrastructure are well known and public and are transparent and predictable \cite{RN7} \cite{RN4}. This is problematic since this infrastructure
is seen as a critical service by many industries including utility management, healthcare/ emergency services and security.
Having such a system so prone to threats is not ideal. The further development of SDR platforms has driven down the cost of launching
such exploits. Devices such as the HackRF, USRP, BladeRF and others have been documented for this use \cite{RN4} \cite{RN9}.

\medskip

An issue that arises when attempting to spoof a mobile device is that these devices are also able to determine locaiton based off of
network connection. \todo{insert citation for finding location from cellular/wifi connection}
K. Zeng et al. \cite{RN9} found that when these kinds of devices registered a difference in location between network based and GPS based
that they would prioritise the GPS based location. \todo{I think this is wrong}\emph{This is less of an issue than at first glance since the prevalence of VPN (virtual private networks)
are increasing for surcumventing geolocking features. Therefore to ensure that GPS locaiton services still function when a VPN is active
the GPS position should be prioritised.} There are other methods of detecting a faulty GPS signal in software and hardware that are
more accurate and allow for more flexibility of the device usage. 

\bigskip

\citeauthor{RN12} \cite{RN12} commented on the effect of GNSS spoofing of a cooperative victim. That is when someone is willing to aid the attacker
in performing an attack. This may be implemented to circumvent position based restrictions or if being GPS tracked during certain activities.
\citeauthor{RN12} used the example of a fisherman wanting their GNSS receiver to falsely report the boad had stayed out of protected areas.

\subsection{Spoofing Attack References}

\textbf{\emph{Hijacking Unmanned Aerial Vehicle by Exploiting civil GPS vulnerabilities Using SDR} by X. Zheng et al.}\\
As written by X. Zheng et al. \cite{RN4} there has been an exponential increase in the number of UAV vehicles being used in recent times.
This increase has been driven by the advent of aerial photography of both professionals and amateurs since the cost of entry is so low. There are
also companies looking to implement delivery services using UAV, or drone, technology.
This poses security and safety concerns with such vehicles having such a reliance on GPS for accurate positioning. Having such an open and transparent
infrastructure such as that of GPS makes the signals easy to reproduce for nefarious purposes. Adding to the concern is the increase in 
affordable and high performance SDR platforms as well as open source software packages designed to minimise complexity of performing such tasks. X.Zheng et al.
showed that performing spoofing attacks on UAV vehicles is cheap and simple to control. Zheng performed 3 different hijacking attacks on the target
UAV, namely forcing the drone to land, guiding the drone to an attacker dictated area and forcing the drone to land in an attacker dictated area.
Two of the attack methods were successful at a rate of approximately 80\% and 90\%. The unsuccessful test was attempting to force the drone to land in a specified location by exploiting the 
'go home' safety feature. This requried jamming the communicaiton channel between the controller and drone. After experimentation it was shown
that this required advanced hardware and methods to achieve. Zheng also provided some recommendations for improving the security of the GPS system of, in particular
DJI Phantom 3 drones.
Future works would improve the success rate of the attacks that were successful as well as decrease the time for a successful attack. Work could 
also be put into jamming the control channel between the controller and drone.

\textbf{\emph{Practical GPS location spoofing attack in Road Navigation} by K. Zeng et al.} \\
K. Zeng et al. provide insight into the security concerns of leaning so heavily on the GPS system in general, and more important to this
paper is the reliance on GPS for navigation. In their paper \cite{RN9} K. Zeng et al. were able to develop a practical algorithm
implementation for road network modelling and navigation spoofing using GPS. The attack model used was a hardware based approach. 
The proposed attack strategy leveraged a lunch box sized portable spoofer with the HackRF at the heart of the device. Alot of the effort
of this paper went into the production of the dynamic modelling of road network algorithm. This was done using an XML (extensible markup language)
version of an area of streets as provided by OpenStreetMap. The documentation of this algorithm will become 
useful when moving from a static based spoof attack to a dynamic one.

\medskip

\textbf{\emph{GNSS-SDR: An Open Source tool for Researchers and Developers} by C. Fern\'andes-Prades} \\
The software has undergone continual development since this paper was written. Therefore more recent version of article should be found.
Although information may still be relevant \cite{RN16}.
In 2011 C. Fern\'andes-Prades et al. developed an open source piece of software for the development and implementation of software defined radio based
GNSS receivers. At the time there was a void of accessible software radio solutions that allowed the used to investigate how a GNSS receiver worked.
The author mentions existing commercial products, as they allow for the useage of the data that GNSS systems provide.
The paper walks through the architecture of the GNSS-SDR program.

\textbf{\emph{GPS Vulnerability to Spoofing Threats and a Review of Antispoofing Techniques} by A. Jafarnia-Jahromi} \\
In 2012 \textcite{RN6} noted that with the dependancy that society has developed on GPS it has become a viable attack target. One type attack is
so called spoofing. Spoofing and anti spoofing algorthims and techniques have become an area of interest for researchers of late. \citeauthor{RN6}
investigated the different spoofing and antispoofing techniques avaialble. The author noted that spoofing attacks can be divided into 3 main categories:
GPS signal simulator, Receiver-Based spoofers and Sophisticated Receiver based spoofers. These attack strategies come about because of vulnerabilities in the GPS system.
These vulnerabilities can be described in teh three opoerational layers of GPS, signal processing, data bit, and position/navigation solutions.
Antispoofing can be broken down into 2 groups spoof detection and spoof mitigation, with each of these being able to be further broken into subcategories.
The effectiveness of each spoof detection technique was tabulated and compared. As was the spoof mitigation techniques. Each detection and mitigation
method was given a complexity, effectiveness and spoofing sceario generality rating with notes made about the recived capability requirements.
Testing spoofing techniques is difficult to achieve since there are regulations around the emmision of EM radioation at certain frequencies and power levels.
There were three methods used to test the spoofing/antispoofing techniques. These were Indoor retransmission, spoofing using recorded data (No RF transmission), and
using RF combiners to combine authentication and spoofed signals.
The results that were acquired showed that the commercial GPS receivers were vulnerable to a number of spoofing techniques. It was also
shown that with modest, low complexity spoof detection and mitigation strategies some of the spoof attacks were able to be overcome.

\subsubsection{Spoofing Detection}

\textbf{\emph{GNSS Spoofing and Detection} by M. Psiaki et al.} \\
\textbf{This is a really good reference for the state of play in the spoof attack and defence landscape. Spend time reading about the techniques and 
gain an understanding}.\\
In 2016 M. Psiaki et al. \cite{RN12} reviewed the state of GNSS spoofing and spoofing defences. Since 2008 there has been an ever increasing 
interest in GNSS spoofing. A spoofer could potentially target both military and civilian infrastructure including aircraft or marine vessels which
rely on GNSS signals especially in low visibility conditions. Civilian infrastructure like cell phone towers, power grid monitoring and stock markets
use GPS signals for precise timing. This paper looks at the details of the current methods of implementing a GPS spoof attack as well as the details
of known anti spoofing techniques. Attack methods tested were self consistent spoofer, Meaconing and estimate and replay attacks, other advanced techniques.
Defence techniques can be broken down into three categories; pseudorange RAIM (receiver autonomous integrity monitoring),
looking at the difference between a true and spoofed signal, and looking for interaction between true and spoofed signals. Pseudorange RAIM is considered
too weak against modern spoofing attacks and was not considered in this publication. The specific methods of defence tested in this paper  
were advnaced signal processing techniques, encryption based, drift monitoring, signal geometry and multi pronged spoofing defence.
A \todo{include table in lit review}table was generated to visualise which defence stratagies were effective against which attack strategies. 
It was found that all attack strategies that were used in the report were effective against COTS (commercial off the shelf) GNSS receivers. The authors
recommend COTS GNSS receiver producers implement, at a minimum, a rudamentary defence strategy against spoof attacks. 

\medskip

\textbf{\emph{Spotr: GPS Spoofing detection via Device Fingerprinting} by M. Foruhandeh et al.}\\
As discussed in \cite{RN7} GPS (Global Positioning System) has become the de facto positioning infrastructure for civilian and 
military usage and while there are other satellite based positioning systems that are becoming more popular (GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou) GPS is 
still the one that most people think of when thinking about GNSS. GPS provides this service globally and efficiently although through its ubiquity
security concerns have become apparent. Attacks have been carried out in both an academic and industry setting.
The authors believed that strengthening of the GPS framework against manipulation and exploitation must be a priority.
Proposed methods of hardening GPS have been previously proposed, however these were typically abandoned due to expense, complexity, cost or lack of robustness. 
A method of creating unique satellite "fingerprints" was developed and tested against all known spoofing attacks at time of publish.
This fingerprint algorithm was able to determine if a transmission was authentic or spoofed.
This fingerprinting algorithm implementation was found to be fast, simple, cost effective and robust when compared to previous hardening attempts. \todo{Fact check the claims of the paper}

\subsubsection{Spoofing Mitigation}

\textbf{\emph{A Low complexity GPS anti-spoofing method using multi antenna array} by S. Daneshmand et al.} \\
In 2012 S. Daneshmand et al. \cite{RN8} proposed a low computational complexity anti spoofing module for use with GPS receivers.
It was mentioned that previous anti-spoofing reasearch was done in two categories, spoofing detection and spoofing mitigation.
Most of the effort has been put into spoofing detection algorthims and less on mitigation techniques. 
Previous proposed spoofing mitigation devices used the fact that GPS spoofing devices typically transmit multiple PRN's. 
Therefore comparisons can be made between the spoofed and authentic signals. Although this is computationally complex. This proposed
device uses a multi antenna array to find the signal with most power and beam form in such a way that the antenna null is pointing in
that direction. This relies on the assumption that spoofed signals will have a measurably higher spatial energy than that of the authentic signal
as well as the authentic signal propogating from an area that is not also covered by an antenna null. Although this cannot be guarenteed.
To maximise the perfomance of the module, the authors also propose a technique to amplify the authentic signals as well as reduce the noise floor level.
S. Daneshmand mentioned that with some minor modifications the proposed module would be able to opearate with GLONASS and Galileo systems aswell. 

\medskip

\textbf{\emph{Practical Cryptographic Civil GPS signal authentication} by K. Wesson et al.} \\
K. Wesson et al. \cite{RN13} proposed a method for counteracting GPS spoofing on the popular GPS civil band. The proposed method would use cryptographic
authentication based techniques to ensure that signals were not fake and did orginate from an autorised source.\todo{write more}
\citeauthor{RN13} provided a detailed overview of the entire cryptographic authentication system.
The method employed by \citeauthor{RN13} included adding digital signatures within the GPS civil navigation message. This type of cryptographic defence
will secure the receiver against replay spoof attacks. Authentication of each civil GPS signal is performed every 5 minutes.
For the proposed authentication strategy a $P_D$ of >0.97 was achieved over the range of $37$-$51 dB-Hz$.
The implementation of such a system would require modifications to the GPS satellite system themselves, as well as a redesign of GPS receivers.
The modifications required for the GPS recievers were documented in detail in \cite{RN13}. For systems that can not easily or readily upgraded to
take advantage of these improvements an external device called "The GPS Assimilator", as proposed in \cite{RN19}, could be used to clean the incomming
signals.
Although it was noted that receivers based on SDR platforms would be able to implement the authentication algorithm easily.

\medskip

\textbf{\emph{\citetitle{RN17}} by \citeauthor{RN17}} \\
In \citeyear{RN17} \citeauthor{RN17} \cite{RN17} noted that the GPS navigation system is susceptible to electro magnetic interference. Sources of interference 
can either be natural or artifical including malicious sources (spoofing). This has the potential to threaten the reliabilty of the system which has become 
vital in accurate position and timekeeping purposes. One such use is within modern vehicles for positioning, navigation and automation. 
CACC (Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control) systems are an evolution of ACC (Active cruise control) and include a communication stack for V2V (vehicle to vehicle) communicaiton. 
Vehicles that have a CACC system thus have a number of other sensors which are able to provice situational awareness. These include the formentioned radio
communications equipment as well as Lidar, radar, camera  IMU's (inertial measurement unit) and access to CAN data from the vehicle systems.
\citeauthor{RN17} devised a method of maintaining awareness of position from a combination of GPS signal as well as the other sensors as part of
the various other systems integrated into the vehicle and from other vechiles. It was shown experimentally that the COTS receivers were susceptible to
to spoofing attacks. It was also shown that the proposed method of spoof detection and removal was effective. Furhter work will need to be done
to test the defence method on more spoof attack methods. To ensure that this design becomes viable for the commercial world it must also work in real time.

\medskip

\textbf{\emph{\citetitle{RN18}} by \citeauthor{RN18}} \\
In \citetitle{RN18} \citeauthor{RN18} \cite{RN18} pointed out that there is a cycle of new spoofing attack strategies and then counter-measures
against them. A sudden outage to GNSS systems would have a large impact on society. \citeauthor{RN18} provided a list of GNSS-reliant ecosystems including
autonomous transportation, cellular networks and power systems. Disruptions to especically the later two would have a measureble impact. Therefore, it is
important to ensure that receviers of GNSS signals are resilient to intentional and unintentional interference.
Typical COTS GNSS receviers do not have a way of being upgraded since their hardware is set and not able to change. Having a receiver
with upgradable hardware, such as that found in SDR platforms, would make for an ideal GPS reciever. As such SDR's are well suited as GNSS receivers,
however, they are challenged by processing the GNSS data and anti spoofing method. \citeauthor{RN18} performed experiments to see how effective SDR 
platforms were at implementing a mitigation strategy in real time. A reduced complexity MMSE (minimum mean squared error) algorithm was developed for
use on the in house developed SDR platform. This algorthim was compared against MF (matched filter) techniques. It was found that at an ISR (interference to signal ratio)
of 30dB that MF correlators were unable to recive any useable signal, with BER (bit error rate) of approximatelty 50\%. Using the proposed maximise
correlator, at a 30dB ISR, showed a BER gain of approximately $10^5$. 
However, in testing it was found that most COTS receivers were not able to perform these duties in real time due to the increase in complexity of the antispoofing algorthims.

\subsubsection{Other References}

\textbf{\emph{Design of complete Software GPS Simulator with low complexity and precise Multipath Channel model} by A. Elango et al.} \\ 
In 2016 A. Elango proposed a completly software based approch to simulating GPS singals \cite{RN15}. A summary of the difference between analog
and digital based simulation systems is provided, with justification for producing a softawre based solution. In this proposal the GPS signals are created
using a custom piece of software. The output of this software is a message that has already been moudlated, which is saved into a file on the local
storage device. This was then fed into a MATLAB simulation environment for testing. The psudo code for the development of the program is include in
the publication, and provides a good resource for breaking down the message structure for GPS.

\subsection{Literature Review methodology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exclusion criteria \\ To help narrow the scope of the literature review certain criteria was selected to be ommited
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Age of source: > 2010 for SDR specific | > 2008 for all others \\ When it comes to the implementation of spoofers using SDR platforms, the most up to date inforamtion is requried since the software typically used in these cases are open source and prone to frequent changes.\\ This is less of an issue when detailing the operationa of the GPS navigation system, or, to a lesser extent, effective spoofing attacks and defences. This is because most off the shelf receivers have not got any spoof mitigation built into their designs \cite{RN12}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Inclusion criteria
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Application specifics \\ While not all sources will have an application, whether to attack or defend, it should be noted that there was an importance placed on getting sources that applied the theory described.
        \item SDR implementation \\ Since this project relied on the use of an SDR platform for the application of a spoofer it was important that a large number of sources also use a similar platform. This helped in forming a strategy to compolete the project. It was also important so that time was not wasted reinventing the wheel.
