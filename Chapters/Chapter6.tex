\section{Future Work}
All of the tests that have been conducted for use in this thesis have either been generating a signal based off a predetermined location (coordinate) or a predetermined
path, or attempted meaconing attack. None of these options have a mechanism for position feedback. For example you cannot create a signal that has a linear offset from
the actual position using these methods. This is something that could be achieved through combination and modification of the exitisting open source projects used in this
thesis. This would allow for properly real-time gps spoofing, and could be extended further to have intelligent algorithms.
