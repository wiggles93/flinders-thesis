abstract = {Detection and prevention of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) “spoofing” attacks, or the broadcast of false global navigation satellite system services, has recently attracted much research interest. This survey aims to fill three gaps in the literature: first, to assess in detail the exact nature of threat scenarios posed by spoofing against the most commonly cited targets; second, to investigate the many practical impediments, often underplayed, to carrying out GNSS spoofing attacks in the field; and third, to survey and assess the effectiveness of a wide range of proposed defences against GNSS spoofing. Our conclusion lists promising areas of future research.},

  abstract={Intentional interference in satellite navigation is becoming an increasing threat for modern systems relying on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). In particular, critical applications such as aviation can be severely affected by un-detected and un-mitigated interference and therefore interference management solutions are crucial to be employed. Methods to cope with such intentional interference enclose interference detection, interference mitigation, interference classification, and interference localization. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of interference management methods developed in the last four decades by the research community. After reviewing the main concepts of GNSS-based navigation, the interference and interference management solutions are classified, with a particular focus on the two major threats in GNSS navigation, namely jamming and spoofing. Mathematical models, comparative tables for various interference management solutions, such as detection, localization, mitigation, and classification, as well as comparative numerical results based on several selected algorithms are also presented. We especially focus on algorithms relying on omni-directional antennas, which do not require additional specific antennas to be installed on the aircraft and thus reduce the costs of retrofit and installation.},
