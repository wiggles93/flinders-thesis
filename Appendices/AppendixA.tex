\section{GPS Position and Signal Quality}
\textbf{Filename:} NMEA.py\\
\textbf{Description:} This code will take a NMEA file as input and calculate the time to first fix, then plot the carrier to noise ratio of every satellite that was
within view of the receiver, then plot the position given the output of the GPS receiver.
