\section{GPS Sentence Parsing and Graphing} \label{sec:NMEACode}
\textbf{Filename:} NMEA.py\\
\textbf{Description:} This code will take a NMEA file as input and calculate the time to first fix, then plot the carrier to noise ratio of every satellite that was
within view of the receiver, then plot the position given the output of the GPS receiver.

\section{GPS Ephemeris download script} \label{sec:EphemerisCode}
\textbf{Filename:} remote\textunderscore ephemeris\textunderscore utc.py\\
\textbf{Description:} This code will take the current time and and use that to request the latest ephemeris from the CDDIS portal.

\section{Connect to GPS Receiver} \label{sec:GPSConnect}
\textbf{Filename:} Connect\textunderscore receiver.sh\\
\textbf{Description:} Script that was used to set the permissions on the USB GPS receiver and then connect to the serial interface using the screen program. The script
would take 1 argument that was used to save the logfile.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, caption=Bash script to connect to USB GPS receiver]
    #!/bin/bash

    filename=$1
    
    chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
    screen -L -Logfile $filename /dev/ttyUSB0
