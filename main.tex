% \noindent\enquote{\itshape One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not that of becoming your own father or mother. There is no problem in becoming your own father or mother that a broad-minded and well-adjusted family can't cope with. There is no problem with changing the course of history—the course of history does not change because it all fits together like a jigsaw. All the important changes have happened before the things they were supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the end.

% The major problem is simply one of grammar, and the main work to consult in this matter is Dr. Dan Streetmentioner's Time Traveler's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations. It will tell you, for instance, how to describe something that was about to happen to you in the past before you avoided it by time-jumping forward two days in order to avoid it. The event will be descibed differently according to whether you are talking about it from the standpoint of your own natural time, from a time in the further future, or a time in the further past and is futher complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations while you are actually traveling from one time to another with the intention of becoming your own mother or father.

% Most readers get as far as the Future Semiconditionally Modified Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up; and in fact in later aditions of the book all pages beyond this point have been left blank to save on printing costs.

% The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy skips lightly over this tangle of academic abstraction, pausing only to note that the term "Future Perfect" has been abandoned since it was discovered not to be.}\bigbreak

	As GNSS technology becomes more and more prevalent in society more needs to be done to ensure that it remains a robust system. There is a distinct issue with
	satellite technology. That is that the design life time leaves them open to attack as technology propels forward. Especially over the past 15 years the rate of
	expansion of technology has been high. While the GNSS system as a whole may have been technologically advanced compared to civilian technology when launched, that
	technology, and others, trickles down in to the hands of attackers. This thesis pointed out the ease in which a spoofing attack was able to be performed. 
	
	\bigskip

	The results
	show that with relatively low amounts of money and processing power, as well as technical understanding, successful spoofing attacks were performed. Using free and
	available software coordinates were chosen either a stand alone coordinate for a static spoof, or connected to form a path for a dynamic spoof. The coordinates were
	saved as text files that were passed into another software program, GPS-SDR-sim that converted the text file into a interlaced I/Q signal data file. This was loaded
	into the SDR via the GNURadio program and ethernet interface. The victim receivers were successfully spoofed, however the accuracy of the calculated location was less
	than what was expected for static attacks, with error values consistently over 20m. Dynamic spoofed scenarios seemed to fair much better with less error. 
	
	\bigskip
	
	While
	it is also true that with the setup used for testing that there were clear signs that the signal was spoofed there are products that do not have the processing power
	to perform software based anti spoofing checks. These include embedded systems, as well as existing systems. 
	Many industries are reluctant to change equipment for many years, even in important industries like energy. This leaves this infrastructure open to attacks from this
	kind of system especially given how portable it is \cite{RN58}.

I wish to thank all those that have supported me through not only my thesis, but my entire degree. In particular Saeed, who guided me through the process of performing an
Honours project. My parents have always been supportive of my decisions and I could not have made it this far without them. Most importantly I'd like to thank Jacqueline
Miller for her endless patience for me through the early years of my degree and her endless compliments as well as grammatical help. To everyone who has had to listen to
my endless ramblings about whatever it was I was working on at the time, thank you.
